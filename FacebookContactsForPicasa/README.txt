This pre-alpha version needs a Facebook API and a Secret Key.
Change FacebookFriendFetcher.java by filling API_KEY and SECRET static variables.

Picasa keeps the contacts in an xml file called "Contacts.xml" (At least in v3.6.1).
Search that in your Picasa installation folder. After generating a new contacts.xml, change 
the original (backup the original first).
