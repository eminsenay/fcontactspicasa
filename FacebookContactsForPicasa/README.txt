Picasa keeps the contacts in an xml file called "Contacts.xml" (At least in v3.6.1).
Default contacts.xml paths for different platforms are as follows:
Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Picasa2\contacts\contacts.xml
MacOS X: cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Picasa3/contacts/contacts.xml
After generating a new contacts.xml, change the original (get a backup of the original first).
